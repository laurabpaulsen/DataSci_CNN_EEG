# DataSci_CNN_EEG
This repository holds the code for the final project for Data Science (S2024). This includes preprocessing of EEG data, converting the timeseries from the sensors to gramian angular & Markow transitional fields, and the training and testing 3D convolutional neural networks on the data.

## Notes on the exam
* Length for one student: 10-12 standard pages
* Should include a product - can be a GitHub repository with the code or a pipeline
    * "The product must be accompanied by a take-home assignment on a topic of the studentâ€™s choice, in which the student explains the relevance and methodological and theoretical basis of the product. The assignment and the product must be submitted for assessment in WISEflow before the deadline set in the examination plan. Assessment is based on an overall assessment of the take-home assignment and the practical product."
